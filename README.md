Implementation and reproducing paper "Improving Explorability in Variational Inference with Annealed Variational Objectives Bayesian methods"

We planned to use and rewrite some code from https://github.com/joelouismarino/iterative_inference/, https://github.com/jmtomczak/vae_householder_flow, https://github.com/AntixK/PyTorch-VAE, https://github.com/haofuml/cyclical_annealing and https://github.com/ajayjain/lmconv. (We assume, that first two repositories were used in the original paper closed source code)
