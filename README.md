Implementation and reproducing paper "Improving Explorability in Variational Inference with Annealed Variational Objectives Bayesian methods"

We planned to use and rewrite some code from \url{https://github.com/joelouismarino/iterative_inference/}, \url{https://github.com/jmtomczak/vae_householder_flow}, \url{https://github.com/AntixK/PyTorch-VAE}, , \url{https://github.com/haofuml/cyclical_annealing} and \url{https://github.com/ajayjain/lmconv}. (We assume, that first two repositories were used in the original paper \cite{main_Huang2018ImprovingEI} closed source code)
